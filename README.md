This repository contains my personal contributions to our Final Year Project (FYP), titled "Developing Robot SHARE-C's Full Autonomy."

The system was primarily developed on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 and an Arduino Mega, communicating using rosserial on ROS Melodic.

My work involved:

- Integrated **RTAB-MAP** for perception, including mapping and localization both experimentally and in simulation (Gazebo)

- Set up, developed and configured **move_base** path planning.

- Developed low-level **PID controllers** on the Arduino.

- Implemented **keyboard teleoperation** for manual robot control.

- Created a custom **battery monitoring** node to estimate and publish battery percentage from voltage sensor's readings.

Note: This repository includes only the components I developed. Other aspects of the project (e.g., SLAM tuning, GUI, mechanical design) were handled by my teammates.
